## Temperature Trends: The Effects of Climate Change 
In this project, we aim to use some models that predict future climate changes based on past temperature trends. Our purpose is to raise awareness among environmentalists and the general public about the impacts of climate change on our environment. These models will help illustrate potential future scenarios and informations to the audience on climate issues.
